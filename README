ALGORITHM
=========

This is a personal repository for tracking progress through data structures
and algorithms. It contains solutions implemented in Rust, Python, and C++.



REPOSITORY STRUCTURE
====================

The repository is structured as follows:

  cses/          Algorithm practice platform.
  leetcode/      Challenge solutions.
  logs/          Crontab, GitHub, and fetcher execution logs.
  marisaoj/      Algorithm practice platform.
  playground/    Personal sandbox.
  scripts/       Automation and sync scripts.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

  - Rust, Cargo.
  - C++17 or later.
  - Python 3.10+



AUTOMATION
==========

If you are not interested in my boring repo, feel free to use my automated 
LeetCode fetcher. It uses the LeetCode GraphQL API to sync your solutions.


The tool is currently in a "bare-bones" state and is not fully documented.
If you wish to use it, please raise an issue on GitHub, and documentation
will be provided upon request.


SETUP
-----

>> .env
The tool requires a '.env' file in 'scripts/fetch_leetcode/'.
Template:
  LEETCODE_SESSION=<your_session_cookie>
  CSRF_TOKEN=<your_csrf_token>
  USER_AGENT=<your_user_agent>


>> crontab

Example crontab configuration (This is my setup):
  # 1. Fetch data from LeetCode (21:55)
  55 21 * * * /bin/bash /path/to/repo/scripts/fetch_leetcode.sh

  # 2. Sync changes to GitHub (22:00)
  0 22 * * * /bin/bash /path/to/repo/scripts/sync.sh

>> details

How to get credentials:
  1. Log in to leetcode.com in your browser.
  2. Open Developer Tools (F12) -> Application (or Storage) tab.
  3. Look under Cookies -> https://leetcode.com.
  4. Copy the 'LEETCODE_SESSION' and 'csrftoken' values into your .env.

To run the fetcher:
  $ cd scripts/fetch_leetcode && cargo run --releas

HOW TO BLAME MY CODE 
====================
If you find a bug, a suboptimal complexity (O(N^2) when O(N log N) is possible), 
or just hate my coding style, feel free to submit a Pull Request.

Workflow:
  1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
  2. Create a descriptive feature branch:
     $ git checkout -b fix-this-mess
  3. Modify the code. Ensure your solution passes the existing constraints.
  4. Write a brief explanation in your commit message or PR description 
     explaining why my original solution was garbage.
  5. Push to your fork:
     $ git push origin fix-this-mess
  6. Open a Pull Request against the 'main' branch of this repository.

I will review your "blame" and merge it if it is technically superior.
Please do this—it helps me learn and improves the rigor of this repository.
